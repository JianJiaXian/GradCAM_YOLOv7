#  GradCAM on YOLOv7 â€” Visualizing What YOLO Learns

This project integrates **GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** with **YOLOv7** to better understand **which features** the model focuses on when making detection decisions.

---

##  Motivation

- YOLO series models are widely known for their excellent performance on object detection tasks.
- But do they really "understand" the objects they detect?
- This project visualizes YOLOv7's internal attention using GradCAM to **reveal which parts of the image influence detection results**.

##  What is GradCAM?

**GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** is an Explainable AI (XAI) technique to:

- Visualize important regions that contribute to a modelâ€™s prediction.
- Provide interpretability and diagnostic power during training or production.

GradCAM works by:
- Extracting activations from intermediate layers.
- Weighting these activations using the average gradient with respect to the predicted class.
- Overlaying the heatmap onto the original image to highlight influential regions.

##  Code Modifications

To support GradCAM visualization, a few changes are needed in YOLOv7â€™s original codebase.

###  Modify Original YOLOv7 Files

- `./model/yolo.py`  
- `./model/experimental.py`

###  Add New Files

- `./model/gradcam.py` â€“ Core GradCAM logic
- `./model/yolov7_object_detector.py` â€“ YOLOv7 wrapper for GradCAM
- `main_gradcam.py` â€“ Main script to run GradCAM visualizations

---

##  Results

Example output below shows the GradCAM visualization overlaying the detection result, helping interpret what the YOLOv7 model "sees".

##  TODO

- [ ] Add detailed code explanations and annotations
- [ ] Extend to other YOLO versions (e.g., v5, v8)
- [ ] Combine with other XAI tools (e.g., Score-CAM, LIME)
